OpenCOR preferences are currently limited to the style used to render the :ref:`GUI <userInterfaces_graphicalUserInterface>`.
Thus, on `Windows <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`__, we can choose between the ``Fusion``, ``Windows``, ``WindowsVista`` and ``WindowsXP`` styles while on `Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`__, we can choose betwen ``Fusion`` and ``Windows``, and between ``Fusion``, ``Macintosh`` and ``Windows`` on `macOS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS>`__.
``WindowsVista`` is the default style on `Windows <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`__ while it is ``Fusion`` on `Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`__ and ``Macintosh`` on `macOS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS>`__.
