 SimulationExperimentView plugin
=================================

The SimulationExperimentView plugin can be used to run `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`__ and `SED-ML <http://www.sed-ml.org/>`__ files, as well as `COMBINE <http://co.mbine.org/>`__ archives.
However, OpenCOR only supports a subset of `SED-ML <http://www.sed-ml.org/>`__, so only `SED-ML <http://www.sed-ml.org/>`__ files and `COMBINE <http://co.mbine.org/>`__ archives generated by OpenCOR are guaranteed to work.

A `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`__ file describes either a system of `ordinary differential equations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation>`__ (ODEs) or `differential algebraic equations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_algebraic_equation>`__ (DAEs).
