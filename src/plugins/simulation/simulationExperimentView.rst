 SimulationExperimentView plugin
=================================

The SimulationExperimentView plugin can be used to run `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`__ and `SED-ML <http://www.sed-ml.org/>`__ files, as well as `COMBINE <http://co.mbine.org/>`__ archives.
However, OpenCOR only supports a subset of `SED-ML <http://www.sed-ml.org/>`__, so only `SED-ML <http://www.sed-ml.org/>`__ files and `COMBINE <http://co.mbine.org/>`__ archives generated by OpenCOR are guaranteed to work.

A `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`__ file describes either a system of `ordinary differential equations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation>`__ (ODEs) or `differential algebraic equations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_algebraic_equation>`__ (DAEs).

Open a CellML file
------------------

Upon opening a `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`__ file, OpenCOR checks that it can be used for simulation.
If it cannot, then a message describing the issue is shown:

On the other hand, if you open a valid `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`__ file (e.g. ``models/noble_model_1962.cellml``, which is shipped with OpenCOR), then the view will look something like:

It consists of two main parts, the first of which allows you to customise the simulation, the solver(s) and the model parameters, as well as to specify which graphs to plot.
The second part is used to plot the requested graphs.
In the ``Parameters`` section, all the model parameters have an icon associated with them to highlight their type:

| |iconVoi|              Variable of integration
| |iconConstant|         (Editable) constant
| |iconComputedConstant| Computed constant
| |iconState|            (Editable) state
| |iconRate|             Rate
| |iconAlgebraic|        Algebraic
